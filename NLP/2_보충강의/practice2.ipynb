How might a good argument for a design be instantiated with effective interface and system models? Taking a step back, are our solutions actually addressing the underlying problem that humans face? What is actually the problem?<br/> <br/> Through the studio method, we will, as a learning community, learn to ask and answer these questions for ourselves. One focus will be on developing our critical thinking and problem solving skills through team projects and studio critique, with special emphasis on learning more effective structures and representations for thinking about the design of HCI systems. Another focus will be on learning to soften into a deeper understanding of problems that people encounter than we might at first assume - that is, developing our capacities for humility, empathy, and curiosity.

We can use grammars to make humorously chatty Twitterbots, Voronoi diagrams to create virtual cities and landscapes, and machine-learned models to generate realistic oil portraits from selfies.', 'Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) serves as the bridge between computing and humanity. The effective design of HCI systems requires a keen understanding of how interfaces and computer systems usefully support human endeavors (or not). Why would a particular set of characteristics of a system lead to reaching a desired outcome, while others encounter an obstacle? How might a good argument for a design be instantiated with effective interface and system models? Taking a step back, are our solutions actually addressing the underlying problem that humans face? What is actually the problem?  Through the studio method, we will, as a learning community, learn to ask and answer these questions for ourselves. One focus will be on developing our critical thinking and problem solving skills through team projects and studio critique, with special emphasis on learning more effective structures and representations for thinking about the design of HCI systems. Another focus will be on learning to soften into a deeper understanding of problems that people encounter than we might at first assume - that is, developing our capacities for humility, empathy, and curiosity. Last but not least, we focus on *doing* — agile sprints, rapid prototyping and testing, iterating — learning to face and embrace fears, imperfections, failures that may otherwise hold us back from moving forward. Through this we will learn to become more skillful in how we work on difficult problems.  REQUIREMENTS FOR ENROLLING, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY: While the course has no formal pre-requisites, learning via a studio method demands that students are open to constructive feedback and critique from the instructor, TAs, and/or peers. It also demands a willingness to learn together, as a community.  Given the course’s ambitious learning objectives—both in the subject area and more generally in how we approach difficult problems—students taking the course should have a strong willingness in learning and growing personally. The course will demand a significant amount of self-direction: students need to be able and willing to learn on their own and in groups through their own volition, and in doing so, still thoughtfully approach challenges new, unfamiliar, and (potentially) uncomfortable ways. In other words, the course is meant for students who are serious about learning how to design computing systems for human use, *and* of ways to work with themselves and teammates through challenges.', 'Introduction to human-computer interaction and the design of systems that work for people and their organizations. The goal is to understand the manner in which humans interact with, and use, their computers for productive work. The course focus is on the interface as designed artifact.

We will discuss some of the constraints that limit the design and programmability of modern processors, and promising techniques to mitigate these constraints. As such, we will draw material from seminal and recent publications in top computer architecture conferences and journals. By exposing the students to state-of-the-art research, the course serves as an entry point to further research in computer architecture. The course will cover a sample of research across a wide spectrum of topics from emerging architectures, including quantum computing, neuromorphic computing, space-time computing, silicon photonics in computer architectures, and advanced techniques in more traditional topics, including memory systems and advanced cache designs, memory consistency models and operational semantics, programmability (e.g., transactional memory, deterministic programming, speculative multithreading), on-chip interconnects, power/thermal management, reliability, and fault tolerance. The exact collection of topics varies across offerings, as the field itself evolves rapidly.

The field of online algorithms focuses on developing and analyzing such systems, and ensuring that they are \"competitive\" against the best solution in hindsight. While online algorithms have been developed for a wide variety of problems, the standard worst-case guarantees turn out to be insufficient in many applications. The question then is if we can use the \"structure\" in real world data to obtain better guarantees. Since structure is a problem-dependent notion, one general way to model it is to assume that there is a predictive model (possibly based on machine learning on past data) that can provide partial information about the problem instance, e.g., about upcoming requests. In this PhD-level course, we will see how to design algorithms that can exploit such \"advice\". We will consider a variety of online problems ranging from data structures and caching to online learning and bandits.[The course will assume familiarity with the design and analysis of algorithms, probabilistic analysis, as well as notions such as approximation factors.]', 'In this seminar course, we will consider what it means to produce reproducible explanations in data-driven science. As the complexity and size of available data increases, intuitive explanations of what has been learned from data are in high demand. However, what does it mean for an explanation to be accurate and reproducible, and how do threats to validity of data-driven inferences differ depending on the underlying goal of statistical modeling? The readings of the course will be drawn from recent and classic literature pertaining to reproducibility, replication, and explanation in data inference published in computer science, statistics, and related fields. The course is structured in three parts. In part one we will examine recent evidence of problems of reproducibility, replicability and robustness in data-driven science.
